* Engine Stuff
** Timer
Want a timer / gameclock that is independant of the real system time. This way
animations and things runat a framerate independant rate. During debugging I
also want to be able to step the frame like a second at a time so it's actually
debugable. This will take some thought.
** Debugging
I want to get a better debug env up. I want a hotkey to run the program with debugging
and I don't want it to launch gdb in the buffer I'm in because then I have to fuck
around with buffers to find the source again.
